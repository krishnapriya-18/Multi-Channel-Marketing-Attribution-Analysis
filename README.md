# Multi-Channel-Marketing-Attribution-Analysis

AIM:
 - Developed a model for analyzing and predicting marketing channel that lead to better conversions.

 - Delivered insights on which model is better for the company’s business.

PROCESS:

 - Build a workflow and test the prototype on happay’s multi channel path data from google analytics.

 - Worked on various approaches including First Touch, Last Touch, Linear and Markov Models. Suggested which and why among these?

Standard Attribution Models provided by Google:

 - Last Touch : the attribution approach where any revenue generated is attributed to the marketing channel that a user last engaged with.
 
  - FIRST TOUCH : The revenue generated by
the purchase is attributed
to the first marketing
channel the user engaged
with, on the journey
towards the purchase.

(While these individual approaches have its advantage in their
simplicity, we run the risk of oversimplifying our attribution, as
the last touch isn’t necessarily the marketing activity that
generates the purchase or so to say only the first touch.)
 
 - LINEAR : In this approach, the
attribution is
divided evenly
among all the marketing
channels touched by the
user on the journey leading
to a purchase.

(It does not distinguish
between the different
channels.)
